# Processing Geodata using Python

## Contents

There is a large amount of Python modules available suitable for spatial data processing. In this talk, it is shown how to analyze, manipulate and visualize geospatial data by using open source modules. The following modules will be introduced:

* Shapely - Manipulation and analysis of geometric objects
* Fiona - The pythonic way to handle vector data
* rasterio - The pythonic way to handle raster data
* pyproj - transforming spatial reference systems
* GeoPandas - Geospatial analysis
* Folium - Creating maps
